# DependencyInjectionDemos

This project aims to show the power of Dependency Injection and why every developer that use Object-Oriented Programming must use DI.
DI is a programming technique (set of patterns) that helps us to make loosley coupled source code. DI is based on Dependency Inversion Principle from SOLID.
Dependency Injection is an implementation of this principle in code and states that we do not have to create our dependencies, instead we have to inject them
from outside via interfaces (mostly via constructor injection). 

What says Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules SHOULD NOT depend on low-level modules. Both SHOULD depend on abstractions.

Important: Dependency Injection is crucial point for every good software engineer. If you want to see the power of Dependency Injection, check the repo.

There is also a presentation about Dependency Injection that shows the code examples on the slides. The same examples with even more explanations are set
in the code itself.
